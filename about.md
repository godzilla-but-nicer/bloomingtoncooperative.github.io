## Mission

Bloomington Cooperative Living creates and maintains affordable, communal
housing in Bloomington, Indiana that is democratically controlled by residents.

Adopted July 2021 by the BCL General Assembly

​As a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, we believe housing is a
human right. We work together to create, maintain and expand affordable housing
in Bloomington, Indiana without a profit motive by: ​

Creating institutional structures that allow community-based ownership and
administration of large assets in order to benefit from economy of scale and
prevent profiteering

​Establishing governance structures and shared values that help us end
exploitation of people in need of housing

Building administrative and decision-making structures that encourage
collective democratic decision-making

​Recognizing the ways in which our members and affiliates are already part of
the communities around us as workers, students, friends and families while
integrating ourselves and our work into local communities and institutions ​

Recruiting members who are capable of providing help and support to other members

​Addressing member's material and emotional needs inter-personally and
institutionally

​Responding to members experiencing distress with compassion and care for both
the member and the community

​
Rejecting the imbalanced power dynamics created by charity

​
Expecting members to contribute to our common cause to the extent they are able

​Asking members to learn and grow in their work toward the fulfillment of all
aspects of this mission statement and supporting one another’s growth to this
end

As part of the BLC mission and commitment to affordable housing, 75% our
members meet national, state, and local low-income standards. All members at
Middle Earth and The Trellis fall below the 80% threshhold for the HUD
Bloomington metro area.

## Houses

Each house, and BCL in general, is run democratically, and all members
contribute their labor in order to keep housing costs affordable. We share
responsibilities for household chores and administrative tasks involved in
running the cooperative. We make decisions by consensus, typically by at least
a 75% majority vote.

As a housing cooperative, we place great value on community. We share communal
meals each night, and we have weekly house meetings. We throw parties, open
mic nights, documentary & movie screenings and other community events. We eat
together, relax together and support one another.
​
​
​
Perhaps most importantly, we are committed to fun and inspiration. We paint.
We build. We sing. We dance. We watch movies. We ask about each others' days.
We really care about the answer. All of this is what makes the cooperative not
just a place to live, but it makes it your home.

## History

​
BCL was founded in 2007 by students from Indiana University.  
In 2010, BCL first leased the houses of Goodlawn and Which House.
In 2011, BCL incorporates as a nonprofit and purchaced Middle Earth. This house is named in homage to its predecessor the Middle Way House.
​
Each house
During the Summer of 2022 and extending into early 2023, Goodlawn is receiving renovations to bring it more in-line with communal living, and in 2019, Which House went through an extensive renovations to enhance its common spaces and private bedrooms.
​
In late 2020, BCL finalized financing and purchasing of our second owned property, located at 921 West 9th Street. We were able to make this purchase through local grants, community-based loans and a traditional mortgage. After that purchase and renovation, The Trellis opened in April 2022. Final touches are being completed at The Trellis. All of our members are excited for The Trellis to have joined us in oue mission.
​
And we're still growing strong! We have announced the addition of a new property, currently being renovated and converted into cooperative house, at 410 West Kirkwood Avenue adjacent to Middle Earth.
