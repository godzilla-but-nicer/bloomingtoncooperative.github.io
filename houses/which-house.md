## About

First leased by BCL in 2010, Which House is located just a few blocks west of Goodlawn and adjacent to the southern edge of the Indiana University campus.
​
The house was remodeled in 2019, though it keeps its charm as a 1890s building on the interior. The main kitchen sits adjacent to a dinning room and a living room.
​
There are three bathrooms with showers. The second floor contains a reading nook with an additional galley kitchen. A wooden deck off the kitchen hosts meals during the warm months, and a covered back porch is used almost year-round.
​

## Rooms

Which house has 12 rooms that range from 100 sqft to 240 sqft. The cost of living per month is between $577 to $753, which is inclusive of the base rent (~$434), food ($127), and utilities ($89).

The first and second floor have vaneer wood floors and fairly high cielings, while the basement has tile floor and a relatively low cielings.
​

## Boarders

​
Our current dinners are primarily vegetarian, generally avoiding some mild allergens. Each week, dinners usually rotate between a curry, a stir fry, a tex-mex, and a "mid-western" adventure. Dinners are prepared each weekday except for Friday, and are at 7pm.
​
We are welcoming of boarders with either full or half board (just dinner). Please contact ____ if you are intersted.
