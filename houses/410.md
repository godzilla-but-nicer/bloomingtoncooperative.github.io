## About

At Bloomington Cooperative Living, we are proud to announce 12 additional units of affordable housing through the acquisition of the property at 410 West Kirkwood Avenue.
​
Our vision is to build our fifth cooperative house by converting this business complex into a shared living space built with the cooperative housing structure foremost.
​
This property adjoins another BCL cooperative house, Middle Earth, and will allow us to experiment with new forms of collaboration and resource-sharing between houses, as well as beautifying the surrounding area.
​
We plan to continue offering one of, if not the lowest, housing cost options in the City of Bloomington when Cost-of-Living, commonly referred to as “rent,” includes your room fee, shared food and necessities, and utilities. Helping to offset the costs of housing, each member devotes roughly 3 hours each week to maintaining the house and our larger organization.
​

## Rooms

​
There are 12 bedrooms in 410. Each room is between \# and \# square feet, with monthly costs set at $610. There are 2 bathrooms.
